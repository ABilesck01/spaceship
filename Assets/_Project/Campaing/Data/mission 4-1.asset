  missionName: Operation Bold Strike
  briefing: Your mission is to lead a direct assault on the Imperial Starbase. The
    Starbase is a linchpin in the Empire's strategy, and destroying it would severely
    cripple their forces. However, the Starbase is heavily fortified, and success
    will require precision and firepower.
  ending: You successfully execute your chosen strategy, either crippling the Imperial
    Starbase or destroying Ascendant Wrath. The Republic forces seize the opportunity,
    turning the tide of the battle. The Galactic Empire retreats, and Earth is saved.
