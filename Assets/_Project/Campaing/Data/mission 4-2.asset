  missionName: Operation Decisive Duel
  briefing: Target the command ship, Ascendant Wrath. This is a riskier approach,
    as it's guarded by elite Imperial pilots, but taking out the flagship could demoralize
    the Empire and scatter their forces. Speed and agility will be your greatest
    assets in this daring mission.
  ending: Despite your best efforts, the mission takes a turn for the worse. The
    Republic's assault falters, and both the Starbase and Ascendant Wrath prove more
    formidable than expected. As Earth falls to the Galactic Empire, you witness
    the consequences of your decision, setting the stage for a grim future under
    imperial rule.
